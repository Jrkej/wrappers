# WRAPPERS
It will provide a website for students to wrap their events of the day into a simple timetable cotaining their lectures and club events

# INTRODUCTION
This project came into existence because our team leader wasn't aware of the events of hackathon because of information overload so we created this application to help other lost souls like him 

# WHAT DOES IT DO?
-It uses `scrapping` to allow a student to just enter his name, enrollment number and sub-batch (`no PASSWORD required`) and get the complete details of his lectures.<br/>
-It also allows clubs to submit their event information with the requirement of a passkey(only accessible to club members).<br/>
-It allows a student to view the complete details of all the lectures and events to be held on a specific day.

# WHY TO USE?
AS you wouldn't want to end up confused and unorganised like our team leader. It would be better to be more aware about all the important occurences to be held on a speific day so students can prepare in advance.
